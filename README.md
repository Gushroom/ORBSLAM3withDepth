# ORBSLAM3withDepth
Collection of script and modified source code to use depth estimation when running ORB-SLAM3 on EuRoC dataset

## Note
There is no promise that any of the code can function normally. This is just a collection for reference and there was no version control in the development process. The script that produced results in the paper may not be the same version as hosted here. Conda environemnts used are not included in the repository, although environment of DAV and Metrics3D should conver most of the dependencies. Changes in the ORB-SLAM3 repository and its dependencies are not included because many changes were made specifically for the project to run on Mac. For questions, email li.tianhao@niuitmo.ru
